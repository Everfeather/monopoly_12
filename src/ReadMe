Milestone Overview

Milestone 1:
-A command line based version of monopoly simplified to only contain basic functionality of the game.
    This functionality includes rolling of the dice, moving around the board, switching turns between players,
    buying properties, paying rent and going bankrupt.

Milestone 2:
- A GUI based version of milestone 1. This milestone also includes unit testing of the game.

Milestone 3:
- Adding additional features to the game like houses, hotels, special properties like go, go to jail, jail,
    railroads and utilities. IN addition the addition of AI players will be added so the user can play against
    AI players if they dont have enough players.

Milestone 4:
-In this final milestone a save/ load functionality will be added to the game as well as international versions
    of the game with different names and properties.



Milestone 1:
As this is the first milestone we have designed and implemented the entirety of the current code base for this
milestone. We have written all files and produced a working CLI game.
