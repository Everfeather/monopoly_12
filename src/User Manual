Monopoly User Manual

Welcome to Monopoly by team 12!!

Thank you for choosing our game, we hope you enjoy.

To get started please run the main function at the end of the GameController.java file.

Congrats! you have officially started monopoly. As you can see it is a CLI based version of the game.

Please enter the number of players you will be playing with. after entering the number of players have
each player choose a piece to play as.

Once all pieces are picked player one will have an autoroll. Player 1 will then we shown what they rolled and what
property they have landed on. there are 2 options:

1. Empty property. These are place holders for more advanced functionality to come in later milestones.
2. A purchasable property.

If they land on 1 their turn is over unless they rolled a double. If they rolled a double the game will roll once again
and they will move to the next space. If they land on 2 they now have 2 options:

1. Purchase the property for the listed price.
2. skip buying the property

If they buy the property the game will add it to the list of properties they own and deduct the value from their
bank account. if they skip their turn will end unless they rolled doubles in which case they will roll again.

This process will continue until all but one player is bankrupt. When all but one player is bankrupt the game will end
and the remaining player will be crowned the winner.

BANKRUPT
In order for a player to go bankrupt they must loose all of their money. When this happens all of their properties
become available for other players to purchase and they are removed from the game. This version of monopoly does not
allow for mortgages or loans.
